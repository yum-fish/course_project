                    <p><b>Today in Tan Town, Beau Ringman has set a new record while painting his</b> new home. In a feat that has captured the imagination of the world, local resident Beau Ringman has achieved the unthinkable: watching a fresh coat of eggshell white paint dry on his living room wall for a record-breaking 8 hours and 43 minutes. 
                    <br><br>
                    The highly anticipated event began at 8:00 am sharp when Ringman pressed "start" on his stopwatch as the last brush stroke was applied. Settling into his recliner with a stoic determination, Ringman refused to let his gaze waver.
                    <br><br>
                    "It was a true test of mental fortitude," Ringman said in an exclusive interview. "At around the 6-hour mark, I started seeing shapes in the subtle changes of hue, but I stayed strong."
                    Witnesses say Ringman only allowed himself two 5-minute breaks. Otherwise, his vigilant stare remained transfixed on the wall.<br><br>
                    Ringman had defeated the previous record holder, an insomniac grandmother from Pink City, by nearly 23 minutes. In celebration of this historic milestone in this new and upcoming field, the mayor has announced a city-wide parade just for Ringman.</p>
